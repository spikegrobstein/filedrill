# FileDrill

A commandline tool for interactively comparing files during reverse engineering.

This is based off of work I've done and tools I've written and re-written when analyzing binary files and network streams for purposes of reverse engineering protocols and file formats.

Basically, this is completely useless, but I wanted to save it somewhere.
